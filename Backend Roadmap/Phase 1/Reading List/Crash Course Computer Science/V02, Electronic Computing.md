This episode explores the transition from electro-mechanical computing to electronic computing, focusing on the key technologies that made this shift possible, and the limitations of earlier systems.

## üìà The Need for More Computing Power

*   The **scale of human systems** increased dramatically in the first half of the 20th century, with the world population nearly doubling.
*   World War I mobilized 70 million people, and World War II involved over 100 million.
*   Global trade and scientific endeavors reached new heights, increasing the demand for automation and computation.
*   This explosion of complexity, bureaucracy, and data drove the need for faster, more efficient computers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Electro-Mechanical Computers

*   Early electro-mechanical computers, though innovative, were **large, expensive, and prone to errors**.
*   The **Harvard Mark I**, completed in 1944, was one of the largest electro-mechanical computers, with 765,000 components, three million connections, and 500 miles of wire.
    *   It used a 50-foot shaft and a 5-horsepower motor to synchronize its internal mechanics.
    *   One of its earliest uses was running simulations for the Manhattan Project.
*   These computers used **relays** as their "brains".
    *   Relays are electrically controlled mechanical switches that open or close circuits.
    *   A control wire creates an electromagnetic field that moves a metal arm to complete the circuit.
    *   The controlled circuit can connect to other circuits or components like motors.
*   **Limitations of Relays**:
    *   Relays have mass, so they can't move instantly between open and closed states.
    *   A good relay in the 1940s could only switch about 50 times per second.
    *   The Harvard Mark I could perform only 3 additions or subtractions per second.
    *   Multiplications took 6 seconds, divisions took 15, and trigonometric functions could take over a minute.
    *   Mechanical components wear out, become sticky, slow, and unreliable over time.
    *   With thousands of relays, the probability of failure increased. The Harvard Mark I had 3500 relays and would have needed a relay replaced on average every day.
    *   They were also susceptible to **"bugs,"** including actual insects that caused malfunctions. The term "computer bug" originated when a moth was found in a malfunctioning relay in the Harvard Mark II.

## üí° The Vacuum Tube Revolution

*   The **thermionic valve**, or vacuum tube, developed in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming, was a crucial step toward electronic computing.
    *   It housed two electrodes in an airtight glass bulb.
    *   One electrode is heated, emitting electrons (thermionic emission).
    *   The other electrode attracts these electrons to create a current, but only if it is positively charged.
*   A **diode** allows one-way flow of current.
*   In 1906, Lee de Forest added a third "control" electrode, creating the **triode**.
    *   A positive charge on the control electrode permits electron flow, while a negative charge prevents it.
    *   Triodes function like relays but have no moving parts, allowing for much faster switching speeds.
    *   Vacuum tubes could switch thousands of times per second.
*   Vacuum tubes became the basis of radio, long distance telephone, and other electronic devices for almost half a century.
*   While an improvement over relays, they were fragile, could burn out, and were initially expensive. By the 1940s, their cost and reliability improved making them feasible for computer use.

## üöÄ Early Electronic Computers

*   The **Colossus Mk 1**, completed in 1943, was the first large-scale use of vacuum tubes for computing.
    *   It was designed by Tommy Flowers and used at Bletchley Park in the UK to decrypt Nazi communications.
    *   It contained 1,600 vacuum tubes, and ten Colossi were built.
    *   It is considered the first programmable, electronic computer but programming involved plugging wires into plugboards.
*  The **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)**, completed in 1946, was the world's first truly general-purpose, programmable, electronic computer.
    *   Designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, it could perform 5000 ten-digit additions or subtractions per second.
    *  It was operational for ten years, and did more arithmetic than the entire human race up to that point.
    *   It was still prone to failure and only operational about half a day at a time.
*   By the 1950s, even vacuum tube-based computing was reaching its limits.

## ‚öõÔ∏è The Transistor Revolution

*   In 1947, Bell Labs scientists invented the **transistor**, a solid-state electronic switch.
    *   Transistors use a semiconductor material that can conduct electricity or resist it, depending on the control wire.
    *   The control wire manipulates the conductivity of the semiconductor, allowing current to flow or be stopped.
    *   The first transistor could switch between on and off states 10,000 times per second.
*   Transistors are smaller, cheaper, more reliable, and faster than vacuum tubes.
*   The **IBM 608**, released in 1957, was the first fully transistor-powered, commercially available computer.
    *   It contained 3000 transistors and could perform 4,500 additions or 80 multiplications or divisions per second.
*   IBM soon transitioned all of its computing products to transistors, making them more accessible.
*   Today, transistors are smaller than 50 nanometers, switch millions of times per second, and can run for decades.

## üìç The Rise of Silicon Valley

*   Transistor and semiconductor development happened in the **Santa Clara Valley**, which became known as **Silicon Valley** because silicon is the most common material used to create semiconductors.
*   Many tech companies, including Intel, have their roots in Silicon Valley.

This episode details the pivotal shift from mechanical to electronic computing, highlighting the transition from relays to vacuum tubes, and ultimately to the game-changing invention of the transistor. This laid the foundation for modern computing.
