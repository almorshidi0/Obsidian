## üíª Installation Overview ‚öôÔ∏è

- Setting up a **development environment** is the first step in building any website.
- While in-browser code editors can get you started quickly, operating in a **real development environment** is essential for long-term success.
- Installing packages, editors, and operating systems can be frustrating but is an invaluable skill.
- The Odin Project supports these operating systems (OS):
    - **macOS**: Requires the installation of a few programs.
    - **Linux (Official Ubuntu flavors)**: Recommended for development because it is free, open source, and works well with programming languages. Development tools are often updated more often on Linux.
    - **Windows**: Not natively supported, requiring workarounds.
- Options for Windows users to create a development environment:
    - **VirtualBox Virtual Machine**: Emulates a computer within your existing OS.
        - Easy to install and risk free.
        - You can remove it if you don‚Äôt like Linux.
    - **Dual-boot Ubuntu installation**: Installs two operating systems on your computer.
        - Allows Linux to use all computer resources, resulting in faster operation.
        - There is some risk involved in changing hard drive partitions, but it is manageable.
        - Gives Linux access to the full capabilities of your hardware.
        - Creates a clean and distraction-free environment for coding.
    - **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)**: Runs a Linux environment within Windows.
        - Provides the advantages of Linux with a simplified installation.
- **Chromebook**: May allow running a Linux terminal.
- The module stresses that modifying or dual-booting your computer will make it easier to program, help create a distraction-free environment, and look good on your resume.
- Reasons to install Linux include:
    - It is tested with The Odin Project directions.
    - There is good community support.
    - Development tools are built for Linux.
    - Many developers use a Unix-based operating system.
    - It uses fewer system resources than Windows.
- **The Odin Project does not support native Windows** as a development environment.
    - It is not feasible to support Windows at this time.
    - Using Windows has not proven to be a path of low resistance.
- **Only laptops, desktops, or supported Chromebooks are supported**. RaspberryPi and other devices are not supported.

## üíæ Installations üíø

- If you are already using macOS, Ubuntu, or an official flavor of Ubuntu with Google Chrome installed, you can skip this lesson.
- This section focuses on setting up the proper environment and installing Google Chrome.
- It's crucial to be mindful of the OS you are using, as the instructions are tested with macOS, Ubuntu, and official Ubuntu flavors.
- You need to decide which environment you will set up, look through the instructions, and then follow them.
- You should install **Google Chrome** because it is used in the lessons and is widely used by developers and consumers.
    - The module links to a usage share of web browsers.

## üìù Text Editors ‚úçÔ∏è

- A text editor is the most used developer tool.
- A good text editor can help you write better code with real-time code checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.
- **Rich text editors** like Microsoft Word are not suitable for writing code because they embed formatting information in the file.
- **Plain text editors** like VSCode only save the text, allowing other programs to execute the code.
- **Code editors** are specialized web development tools that are highly customizable.
- Using a code editor provides benefits such as plugins, syntax highlighting, auto-closing of brackets, and linting.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** is the recommended code editor.
    - It is free, easy to use, has good add-on support and Git integration.
    - It is the most popular code editor among The Odin Project's students and moderators.
    - It works pretty much the same on every operating system.
- **You must use VSCode for this course** and will not be able to get help if you use another editor.
- If you are using a virtual machine, you should install VSCode on your VM.
- You should watch a VSCode tutorial to get an idea of its features.
- VSCode documentation and shortcut guides for Linux and macOS are provided.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Basics üíª

- The command line interface (CLI) is where you enter commands that your computer will run.
- Working with the command line is a **critical skill for developers**.
- You'll learn how to navigate your computer and manipulate files and directories directly from the command line.
- Commands in the terminal are indicated with a `$` or `%` symbol. Do not type the symbol, only the command.
- The module explains that typing passwords in the terminal will not show characters for security reasons.
- You need to learn how to use the command line efficiently.
    - Copy and paste in the command line is done using `Ctrl + Shift + C/V` on Linux or `Cmd + C/V` on macOS.
    - **Tab completion** automatically completes commands and file paths.
    - The shortcut `.` opens an entire project and all of its files in one go, which is commonly used with Git.
- You can open VSCode from the command line by typing `code`.
- Resources assume you have a Desktop folder, and instructions for creating one are provided.
- WSL2 users have specific instructions for downloading and unzipping files.
- The Unix Shell course by the Software Carpentry Foundation is recommended.
    - Focus on the lessons: Download files, Introducing the Shell, Navigating Files and Directories, Working With Files and Directories.
- You should practice creating folders and files using `mkdir`, `touch`, and `cd`.
- You will practice creating, navigating, modifying, and deleting files and directories.
- The module asks you about:
    - What the command line is.
    - How to open the command line on your computer.
    - How to navigate to a particular directory.
    - Where `cd` on its own and `cd ..` will navigate you.
    - How to display the current directory.
    - How to display the contents of a directory.
    - How to create, destroy and rename directories and files.
- Additional resources include the online book "Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous" and Command Line Flashcards.
