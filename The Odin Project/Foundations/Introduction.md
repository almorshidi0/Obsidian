## 🤔 Motivation and Mindset

### 🧠 Growth Mindset

- A growth mindset believes that you can improve with effort and persistence.
- Struggling is part of the learning process.
- Embrace challenges and celebrate your progress.

### 🔄 The Learning Process

- Your mind switches between focus mode (active learning) and diffuse mode (subconscious connections).
- Taking breaks when stuck allows your diffuse mode to work.
- **Understand it, practice it, and teach it.** Teaching others solidifies your knowledge.

### 🆘 What To Do When You're Stuck

- **Google it**.
- Take a break.
- Ask for help in the TOP Discord server, showing that you have already put in the effort.

### 🤖 A Note on AI

- AI code generation tools can create blind spots and knowledge gaps for new learners.
- Relying on AI can hinder the development of research and problem-solving skills.
- **The Odin Project does not recommend using AI tools for your learning**.

### ⏳ Managing Study Time

- Consistency is key.
- The Odin Project is self-paced; don't rush.
- There are no due dates, so spend the time you need to understand the concepts.
- Don't stress! Relax and enjoy the learning process.

### ⛔ Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Procrastination:** Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min work, 5 min break).
- **Not taking breaks:** Regular breaks improve productivity.
- **Digital distractions:** Turn off notifications and use website blockers.
- **Physical distractions:** Find a quiet place or use noise-canceling headphones.
- **Rabbit holes:** Stick to the curriculum and avoid getting sidetracked.
- **Comparing yourself to others:** Compare yourself only to your past self.
- **Counterproductive note-taking:** Make notes that prompt further research, and get comfortable with reading documentation.

## ❓ Asking For Help

### 🗣️ Tips for Getting Help

- Provide your code, error messages, terminal commands, and other relevant details.
- Ask about the problem, not the solution.
- **Share your attempt** so people know what you have tried.
- It's okay to ask where to start if you are stuck, and share pseudo code to clarify your understanding.
