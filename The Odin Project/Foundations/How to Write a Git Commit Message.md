This article emphasizes the importance of writing clear and effective Git commit messages, arguing that they are crucial for project maintainability and collaboration. A well-crafted commit message provides context, explaining _why_ a change was made, not just _what_ was changed.

## Why Good Commit Messages Matter ü§î

- **Context is King:** Commit messages provide the essential context for code changes. A diff shows _what_ changed, but a commit message explains _why_.
- **Collaboration:** Good commit messages show that a developer is a good collaborator.
- **Project Maintainability:** A well-maintained commit log is a powerful tool for project maintainers. It enables efficient use of `git blame`, `revert`, `rebase`, `log`, and `shortlog`.
- **Long-Term Success:** A project's long-term success depends on its maintainability, which is greatly aided by a well-cared-for commit history.
- **Avoid Waste:** Re-establishing the context of code is wasteful, and commit messages reduce this waste.

## The Problem with Bad Commit Messages üò©

- **Inconsistent & Unstructured:** Many Git repositories have commit messages that are messy, inconsistent, and unstructured.
- **Underutilized History:** When commit history is a mess, developers avoid using it, perpetuating a cycle of neglect.
- **Difficult to Understand:** Without clear messages, it's difficult to understand why changes were made months or years ago.

## The Solution: Commit Message Conventions ‚úÖ

Just as programming languages have style conventions, so should commit messages. Teams should agree on conventions for:

- **Style:** Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.
- **Content:** What information to include in the body and what to exclude.
- **Metadata:** How to reference issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc.

## The Seven Rules of Great Git Commit Messages üèÜ

These rules are conventions, not requirements, however, following them will greatly improve your commit history.

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line**:
    - The subject is a short summary; the body provides details.
    - A blank line is crucial; tools can get confused without it.
    - Not every commit needs a body (e.g., simple typo fixes).
    - Use a text editor, not the `-m` option for messages with bodies.
2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters**:
    - Ensures readability and forces conciseness.
    - GitHub warns you if you exceed 50 characters, and truncates after 72.
    - If summarizing is difficult, consider breaking up the commit into smaller commits.
3. **Capitalize the subject line**:
    - Start all subject lines with a capital letter.
4. **Do not end the subject line with a period**:
    - Trailing punctuation is unnecessary and wastes space.
5. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line**:
    - Use a command or instruction form (e.g., "Fix bug," not "Fixed bug").
    - Git uses the imperative mood in its default messages (e.g., `Merge branch`).
    - A good subject line should complete the sentence: _"If applied, this commit will [your subject line here]"_.
6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters**:
    - Git does not wrap text automatically; you must do it manually.
    - Wrapping at 72 characters allows room for Git to indent text.
    - Use a text editor that supports text wrapping.
7. **Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_**:
    - Focus on the _reasons_ for the change rather than the details of _how_ it was implemented.
    - The code should be self-explanatory regarding _how_ it works.
    - Include context that might be lost in the future.

## Example Commit Message Structure ‚úçÔ∏è

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about
72 characters or so.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this change?
Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

## Additional Tips üí°

- **Embrace the Command Line:** The command line offers more power and flexibility than IDE integrations for Git.
- **Read Pro Git:** The Pro Git book is a fantastic free resource for learning Git.

By following these guidelines, you can create a commit history that is both useful and informative, making you a better developer and collaborator! üéâ
